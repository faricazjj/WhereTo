PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As UCSD students, we are familiar with posts that people make on either the ucsd free and for sale 
or the rideshare group pages on Facebook indicating whether they are selling or buying a ride. But
posts do get lost on Facebook after a lot of posts are generated, especially when the long weekend
or break is approaching and everyone is trying to carpool home. At times like this, finding a match
for you may be difficutl, regardless of whether you are the driver or the passenger.

Our app solves this problem by providing a platform for ucsd studetns to have an easier time buying
or selling a ride. The app lets you choose if you are a driver or a passenger to filer out the 
searches. There are options to look through existing posts or create a new post. There will also
be an option to message your potential passenger or driver to communivate/negotiate the specific
locations and bag space. Transactions will be done through Venmo as Venmo's security and
liabilities insurance protects against a majority of theft. In addition, Venmo is an app that is
frequently used by college students for making transactions with one another.

Our goal is to provide an easy and clean user interface for ucsd students to sell or buy a ride 
whether it is to LA, the bay area, or just a trip to downtoan for a concert.
